# Code-Quiz

https://patrickgp.github.io/Code-Quiz/

The premise of this assignment was that as a coding boot camp student I wanted to make and take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores locally. When the user navigates to the "Code Quiz" website they see a start button and a high score button. When they select to start an alert appears notifying them of the rules of the quiz. For every question they answer correctly they earn a 10 second increase and for every incorrect answer they lose 10 seconds. After answering each question they are presented with another question until they hit the maximum questions provided. When all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches zero the game is over and the user will be provided with their total score with the ability to save that score and their name/initials.
